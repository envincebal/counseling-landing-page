          Do you want to learn new ways to cope with your past trauma?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Maybe you often feel on edge without knowing how to relax or “shut it
          off.” Or perhaps you can’t stop those repetitive, nagging thoughts or
          memories. You may be feeling stuck in old ways and old patterns, or
          simply wondering if anyone will ever understand you. Perhaps you’re
          feeling worthless, confused, or alone.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever it is that you’re experiencing, you’re beginning to notice
          the impact of this in every facet of your life:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You find yourself “lashing out” at those around you. But you don’t
            really know why, or how to stop it
          </li>
          <li>You often feel “on edge”</li>
          <li>
            You can’t stop thinking about the painful memories you’ve been
            through, but you don’t know how to change these thought processes
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 className="tfcbt-emphasis">TF-CBT can help.</h5>
        <p>
          It may feel impossible now, but you can feel whole again. You can feel
          composed. You can feel in control of your thoughts, emotions, and
          memories. And I can help you get there.
        </p>
        <p>(TF-CBT) helps you do at least 5 things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Learn relaxation techniques to practice when traumatic memories come
            up
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn different aspects of trauma so that you gain a better
            understanding of who you are, why you feel the way you do, and why
            you react in the ways that you react
          </li>
          <li>
            Identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how they are all
            connected to each other
          </li>
          <li>
            Put all of these elements into practice, so you can take control of
            your life, your relationships, and your goals once again.
          </li>
          <li>
            (Optional Step): Find a trusted person you can tell your story to,
            so that you can feel connected and less alone in your experiences.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’ll help through this process, tailoring each step to your unique
          needs and circumstances. My approach to (TF-CBT) comes from a place of
          compassion and connection: because no one should have to endure the
          pain of trauma alone

        <p>
          <span className="tfcbt-qa">A: </span>We will discuss your experiences,
          your emotions, your thought processes, and your reactions to various
          situations and people. We will then discuss relaxation practices,
          alternative thought processes, and an exploration of your feelings so
          that you can gain a deeper understanding of yourself.

        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="tfcbt-qa">A: </span>For the length of time that feels
          most comfortable to you, because your needs come first and your
          situation is unique. Our sessions will typically last about 50-57
          minutes per session. They start at about once a week or once every
          other week so that we can get to know each other, and we meet less
          often over time as you and I see fit.

        <p>
          <span className="tfcbt-qa">A: </span>While I can never guarantee the
          outcome of therapy for anyone, the fact that you have read this far
          shows how motivated you are to get unstuck from traumatic memories,
          disturbing thought processes, and distressing patterns. We can work
          together to find the coping skills that will work best for you!
