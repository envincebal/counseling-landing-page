          Are you wanting a therapist with a Christian perspective?
        </h5>
        <p>
          Maybe you’re tired of secular approaches to healing, or perhaps you
          want to grow deeper in your faith in a way that brings about healing.
          You may be doing things in your life that go against what you know is
          right, or simply wondering if you should even follow God’s plan
          anymore. Perhaps you’re feeling ashamed of who you are and what you
          have done.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whatever it is that you’re experiencing, you’re beginning to notice
          the impact of this in every facet of your life:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            You’re doing and saying things that you said you would never do or
            say
          </li>
          <li>
            You’re hiding this lifestyle from those who are closest to you due
            to shame and a fear of rejection
          </li>
          <li>
            You don’t know how to change any of this to go back to what you know
            is right
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h5 className="fbcc-emphasis">
          Faith-Based Christian Counseling can help.
        </h5>
        <p>
          It may feel impossible now, but you can live an abundant life. You can
          break free from the chains that hold you captive. You can get unstuck.
          And I can help you get there.
        </p>
        <p>Faith-Based Christian Counseling helps you do at least 3 things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            It helps you to see the Lord as our Wonderful Counselor (Isaiah 9:6)
          </li>
          <li>
            Normalize the idea that it is okay to not be okay, because this is
            the starting point of healing (“In my trouble I cried to the Lord,
            and He answered me.” Psalm 120:1)
          </li>
          <li>
            Connect more deeply with Jesus- the true source of our healing
            (Matthew 11:28-30, John 4:13-14)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I’ll help through this process, tailoring each step to your unique
          needs and circumstances. My approach to faith-based Christian
          counseling comes from a place of experiencing Christ’s healing for
          myself, and wanting to help others to live a life free from shame,
          fear, and vicious cycles.

          <span className="fbcc-qa">Q: </span>What are Faith-Based Christian
          Counseling sessions like?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="fbcc-qa">A: </span>Our sessions can consist of
          prayer, discussing certain scriptures and how they might apply to your
          unique situation, and anything else you find important about your
          faith that you’d like to incorporate into our sessions.

          <span className="fbcc-qa">Q: </span> How long do I need to be in
          therapy?
        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="fbcc-qa">A: </span>For the length of time that feels
          most comfortable to you, because your needs come first and your
          situation is unique. Our sessions will typically last about 50-57
          minutes per session. They start at about once a week or once every
          other week so that we can get to know each other, and we meet less
          often over time as you and I see fit.

        </p>
        <p>
          <span className="fbcc-qa">A: </span>While I can never guarantee the
          outcome of therapy for anyone, the fact that you have read this far
          shows how important it is to you to have a therapist that not only
          understands your faith, but also shares in your faith. Coming to
          therapy for healing without including the True Source of our healing
          (i.e. Jesus) can feel like trying to take a shower without water.
          Let’s keep the Main Thing the main thing.
