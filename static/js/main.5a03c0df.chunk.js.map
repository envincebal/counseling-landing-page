I know that your circumstances are unique, so I offer a warm,\r\n        compassionate, and individualized approach based on your unique\r\n        situation and goals.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        First, we examine different elements of your life, particularly in your\r\n        past, that are causing you to feel stuck, anxious, or stressed right\r\n        now. Then, we explore a treatment option that will that will be most\r\n        effective for you in getting unstuck (see Specialty/Clinical Interests\r\n        page [hyperlink] for more information). Through our work together,\r\n        you’ll feel more understood, less stuck, and more free.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h5 className=\"about-emphasis\">\r\n        I am dedicated to helping people break through their strongholds.\r\n      </h5>\r\n      <p>\r\n        My training in trauma means I have the expertise you need and deserve in\r\n        healing from your past. But at the end of the day, you want to know\r\n        you’re working with someone who “gets” what it means to be an adult\r\n        struggling with feeling stuck in old ways and patterns, right?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I get it because I have devoted my career to working with trauma,\r\n        faith-based concerns, and various other issues. I have also personally\r\n        experienced healing both through the love and grace of Jesus, and also\r\n        through my own personal experiences with some of the methods I currently\r\n        use with my clients in sessions.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I know that you are doing everything you can right now, but nothing\r\n        seems to be working or helping.

Then, I will ask you about specific components of a\r\n          particularly disturbing memory. We will then begin “bilateral\r\n          stimulation,” which involves me guiding you in moving your eyes back\r\n          and forth as you process a memory. This helps the left and right\r\n          hemispheres of your brain to form a more intimate connection so that\r\n          the disturbing memory becomes less disturbing. It also helps your\r\n          mind, emotions, and body to realize that this memory is in the past,\r\n          and that the memory no longer has to be held at the forefront of your\r\n          mind as a protective mechanism.\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          While utilizing the Flash Technique (FT), however, you will not be\r\n          asked to actively think of the disturbing memory. Instead, we will\r\n          process a pleasant memory while briefly re-visiting the disturbing\r\n          memory. This process takes place through a combination of talking and\r\n          tapping.\r\n        </p>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div className=\"emdr-faq-section\">\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span className=\"emdr-qa\">Q: </span>How long do I need to be in\r\n          therapy?\r\n        </p>\r\n        <p>\r\n          <span className=\"emdr-qa\">A: </span>For the length of time that feels\r\n          most comfortable to you, because your needs come first and your\r\n          situation is unique.
