I know that your circumstances are unique, so I offer a warm,\r\n        compassionate, and individualized approach based on your unique\r\n        situation and goals.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p>\r\n        First, we examine different elements of your life, particularly in your\r\n        past, that are causing you to feel stuck, anxious, or stressed right\r\n        now. Then, we explore a treatment option that will that will be most\r\n        effective for you in getting unstuck (see Specialty/Clinical Interests\r\n        page [hyperlink] for more information). Through our work together,\r\n        you’ll feel more understood, less stuck, and more free.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <h3>I am dedicated to helping people break through their strongholds.</h3>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p>\r\n        My training in trauma means I have the expertise you need and deserve in\r\n        healing from your past. But at the end of the day, you want to know\r\n        you’re working with someone who “gets” what it means to be an adult\r\n        struggling with feeling stuck in old ways and patterns, right?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p>\r\n        I get it because I have devoted my career to working with trauma,\r\n        faith-based concerns, and various other issues. I have also personally\r\n        experienced healing both through the love and grace of Jesus, and also\r\n        through my own personal experiences with some of the methods I currently\r\n        use with my clients in sessions.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <br />\r\n      <p>\r\n        I know that you are doing everything you can right now, but nothing\r\n        seems to be working or helping. So when we work together, you won’t just\r\n        get a trained therapist. You’ll get someone who truly understands what\r\n        you’re going through.\r\n      </p>\r\n      [Click Here to Schedule A Session or to Ask Questions] - Link to page to\r\n      contact / schedule\r\n      <h2 className=\"education-experience-title\">Experience & Education</h2>\r\n      <div className=\"education-experience-div\">\r\n        <div className=\"education-div\">\r\n          <h3>Education</h3>\r\n          <h4 className=\"education-experience-subtitle\">Degrees</h4>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Master of Social Work: Hawaii Pacific University</li>\r\n            <li>Bachelor’s of Arts: University of Oregon</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h4 className=\"education-experience-subtitle\">Licensure</h4>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>LCSW-4450: Licensed Clinical Social Worker</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h4 className=\"education-experience-subtitle\">Certifications</h4>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing)</li>\r\n            <li>The Flash Technique </li>\r\n            <li>TF-CBT (Trauma-Focused Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy)</li>\r\n            <li>Maternal Mental Health Professional Certificate</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n          <h4 className=\"education-experience-subtitle\">Other</h4>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Member of New Hope Leeward</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div className=\"experience-div\">\r\n          <h3>Experience</h3>\r\n          <h4 className=\"education-experience-subtitle\">Professional Experience</h4>\r\n          <ul>\r\n            <li>Child Abuse and Neglect</li>\r\n            <li>Childhood Trauma</li>\r\n            <li>Sexual Abuse: Both in Childhood and Adulthood</li>\r\n            <li>Combat-Related Trauma</li>\r\n            <li>Domestic Violence</li>\r\n            <li>Postpartum/Perinatal Mood Disorders</li>\r\n            <li>Severe and Persistent Mental Illnesses (SPMI)</li>\r\n            <li>Houselessness/Homelessness</li>\r\n            <li>Children with Special Needs</li>\r\n            <li>Life Transitions</li>\r\n            <li>Relationship Issues</li>\r\n          </ul>\r\n        </div>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default AboutPage;\r\n","import React from \"react\";\r\nimport \"./EMDRPage.css\";\r\n\r\nconst EMDRPage = () => {\r\n  return (\r\n    <div className=\"section-container\">\r\n      <h2>Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR)</h2>\r\n      <h2>The Flash Technique (FT)</h2>\r\n      <h2>Trauma Therapy in Hawaii </h2>\r\n      [Click Here to Schedule A Session or to Ask Questions] Link to page to\r\n      contact / schedule\r\n      <h3>\r\n        Are old memories and experiences interfering with the life you want?\r\n      </h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        Maybe you had a huge argument with someone you love deeply, or perhaps\r\n        you find yourself pushing people away.

But you don’t\r\n          really know why, or how to stop it\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>You often feel “on edge”</li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          You can’t stop thinking about the painful memories you’ve been\r\n          through, but you don’t know how to change these thought processes\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <h3>TF-CBT can help.</h3>\r\n      <p>\r\n        It may feel impossible now, but you can feel whole again. You can feel\r\n        composed. You can feel in control of your thoughts, emotions, and\r\n        memories. And I can help you get there.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>(TF-CBT) helps you do at least 5 things:</p>\r\n      <ul>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Learn relaxation techniques to practice when traumatic memories come\r\n          up\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Learn different aspects of trauma so that you gain a better\r\n          understanding of who you are, why you feel the way you do, and why you\r\n          react in the ways that you react\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Identify thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, and how they are all\r\n          connected to each other\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          Put all of these elements into practice, so you can take control of\r\n          your life, your relationships, and your goals once again.\r\n        </li>\r\n        <li>\r\n          (Optional Step): Find a trusted person you can tell your story to, so\r\n          that you can feel connected and less alone in your experiences.\r\n        </li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      <p>\r\n        I’ll help through this process, tailoring each step to your unique needs\r\n        and circumstances. My approach to (TF-CBT) comes from a place of\r\n        compassion and connection: because no one should have to endure the pain\r\n        of trauma alone\r\n      </p>\r\n      <h3>It’s time to heal and feel understood.</h3>\r\n      <h4>FAQs:</h4>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span>Q: </span>What are TF-CBT sessions like?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span>A: </span>We will discuss your experiences, your emotions, your\r\n        thought processes, and your reactions to various situations and people.\r\n        We will then discuss relaxation practices, alternative thought\r\n        processes, and an exploration of your feelings so that you can gain a\r\n        deeper understanding of yourself.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span>Q: </span>How long do I need to be in therapy?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span>A: </span>For the length of time that feels most comfortable to\r\n        you, because your needs come first and your situation is unique. Our\r\n        sessions will typically last about 50-57 minutes per session. They start\r\n        at about once a week or once every other week so that we can get to know\r\n        each other, and we meet less often over time as you and I see fit.\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span>Q: </span>How do I know if TF-CBT will work for me?\r\n      </p>\r\n      <p>\r\n        <span>A: </span>While I can never guarantee the outcome of therapy for\r\n        anyone, the fact that you have read this far shows how motivated you are\r\n        to get unstuck from traumatic memories, disturbing thought processes,\r\n        and distressing patterns.
